# Game On - Quick Start Guide

## 🎯 You're Ready to Build!

I've set up the complete foundation for your Game On app. Here's what's been created:

### ✅ What's Ready

1. **Database Schema** - Complete Supabase schema with PostGIS
   - All tables and relationships
   - Row-Level Security policies
   - Triggers for auto-creating profiles and chat threads
   - PostGIS functions for location queries

2. **Project Structure** - React Native + Expo setup
   - TypeScript configuration
   - All dependencies defined
   - Supabase client setup
   - Query functions skeleton
   - Custom React hooks
   - Utility functions

3. **Documentation** - Comprehensive guides
   - Project plan
   - Implementation roadmap
   - Setup guide
   - This quick start

## 🚀 Next Steps (Do These Now)

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
cd gameon
npm install
```

### Step 2: Create Supabase Project

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and sign up/login
2. Click "New Project"
3. **Important:** Select **EU (West)** region
4. Create project (takes ~2 minutes)
5. Note your project URL and anon key

### Step 3: Set Up Database

1. In Supabase dashboard, go to **Database** → **Extensions**
2. Search for "postgis" and click **Enable**
3. Go to **SQL Editor**
4. Run `supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql` (copy/paste and run)
5. Run `supabase/migrations/002_postgis_functions.sql` (copy/paste and run)
6. Verify tables were created in **Table Editor**

### Step 4: Configure Environment

1. Copy `env.example` to `.env`:
```bash
cp env.example .env
```

2. Edit `.env` and add your Supabase credentials:
```env
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxxx.supabase.co
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
```

(You can get these from Supabase Dashboard → Settings → API)

### Step 5: Start Development Server

```bash
npm start
```

Press `i` for iOS simulator or `a` for Android emulator, or scan QR code with Expo Go app on your phone.

## 🎨 UI/UX Design - Your Options

You mentioned Lovable.dev and Ripple.dev. Here's my recommendation:

### Option 1: Design in Figma → Generate with Lovable (Recommended)

1. **Design screens in Figma** (free tier is fine)
   - Login/Signup screens
   - Match feed (list view)
   - Match details
   - Profile screen
   - Create match screen

2. **Export to Lovable.dev**
   - Upload designs
   - Generate React Native code
   - Refine and integrate

3. **Advantages:**
   - Professional designs
   - Code generation saves time
   - Easy to iterate

### Option 2: Start with Code (Faster Start)

1. Build basic screens with simple components
2. Use libraries like:
   - NativeBase (component library)
   - React Native Elements
   - React Native Paper
3. Refine design as you go

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach

1. Use Lovable/Ripple for initial screens
2. Customize and refine in code
3. Build new screens from scratch using existing patterns

## 📱 Building Features - Suggested Order

Based on your roadmap, here's the order I recommend:

### Week 1: Authentication (Start Here!)
1. Create login screen
2. Create signup screen
3. Test authentication flow
4. Set up navigation

**Files to create:**
- `app/(auth)/login.tsx`
- `app/(auth)/signup.tsx`
- `app/_layout.tsx` (root layout with navigation)

### Week 2: Profile Setup
1. Profile creation screen
2. Profile editing
3. Position/skill level selectors

### Week 3: Match Creation
1. Create match form
2. Venue selection
3. Date/time picker
4. Test match creation

### Week 4: Match Discovery
1. Matches list screen
2. Location permissions
3. Fetch nearby matches
4. Display match cards

### Week 5+: Continue with roadmap

See `IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` for detailed feature-by-feature breakdown.

## 🛠️ Development Tips

### 1. Test Frequently
- Test on real devices early
- Use Expo Go for quick testing
- Set up Android/iOS simulators

### 2. Start Simple
- Build the simplest version first
- Add features incrementally
- Don't try to perfect everything at once

### 3. Use Supabase Dashboard
- Monitor database changes
- Test queries in SQL Editor
- Debug realtime subscriptions

### 4. Handle Errors Gracefully
- Always show error messages
- Provide loading states
- Handle empty states

### 5. Location is Key
- Request permissions early
- Test location on real devices (simulators work differently)
- Handle permission denial

## 📚 Key Files Reference

- **Database:** `supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql`
- **Queries:** `lib/supabase/queries.ts`
- **Auth Hook:** `lib/hooks/useAuth.ts`
- **Matches Hook:** `lib/hooks/useMatches.ts`
- **Location Hook:** `lib/hooks/useLocation.ts`

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Missing Supabase environment variables"
- Make sure `.env` file exists
- Check that variables are prefixed with `EXPO_PUBLIC_`
- Restart Expo dev server after changing `.env`

### PostGIS errors
- Make sure PostGIS extension is enabled
- Verify migrations ran successfully

### Location not working
- Check permissions in `app.json`
- Test on real device (simulators have limited location)
- Ensure location permissions are granted

## 📞 Getting Help

1. **Expo Docs:** [docs.expo.dev](https://docs.expo.dev)
2. **Supabase Docs:** [supabase.com/docs](https://supabase.com/docs)

## 🎯 Your First Task

**Right now, do this:**

1. ✅ Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. ✅ Create Supabase project (EU region)
3. ✅ Run database migrations
4. ✅ Set up `.env` file
5. ✅ Start dev server: `npm start`
6. ✅ Test Supabase connection (create a simple test screen)

Once you can connect to Supabase, you're ready to start building features!

## 🚀 You Got This!

You have everything you need:
- ✅ Complete database schema
- ✅ Project structure
- ✅ Type definitions
- ✅ Query functions
- ✅ React hooks
- ✅ Documentation

Now it's time to build! Start with authentication, then move to match creation, then discovery. Take it one feature at a time.

Good luck! 🏆
